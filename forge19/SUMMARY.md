# Advanced Holograms - Port to Minecraft 1.19.2

## Overview
We've successfully ported the Advanced Holograms mod from Minecraft 1.16.5 to 1.19.2. The main challenge was dealing with dependency issues around the EnvyWare API modules, which we resolved by implementing our own utility classes to replace the functionality.

## Changes Made

### API Structure
- Created a complete API package structure under `com.envyful.advanced.holograms.api`
- Implemented core interfaces: Hologram, HologramBuilder, HologramFactory, PlatformHologramManager
- Created the HologramException class for error handling
- Implemented the HologramSaver interface for data persistence

### Utility Classes
- UtilChatColour: For formatting text with color codes
- UtilWorld: For working with Minecraft worlds
- UtilPlayer: For player-related operations  
- UtilConcurrency: For handling thread execution
- UtilPlaceholder: For placeholder replacement
- UtilParse: For type conversion and parsing

### Implementation Classes
- ForgeHologram: Main implementation of the Hologram interface
- HologramLine: Manages individual lines in a hologram
- ForgeHologramBuilder: Implementation of the builder pattern for holograms
- HologramManager: Static manager for all holograms on the server
- ForgeHologramManager: Implementation of the PlatformHologramManager interface
- ForgeHologramTypeAdapter: GSON adapter for serialization and deserialization

### Command System
- Created a simplified CommandFactory to handle command registration
- Updated HologramsCommand and child commands to work with 1.19.2
- Implemented proper event-based command registration

### Configuration
- Simplified the configuration system to use Java Properties
- Made the mod work without requiring external configuration libraries

## Minecraft 1.19.2 Specific Updates
- Updated all class and method names to match 1.19.2 mappings
- Used 1.19.2 networking packets for entity spawning and updates
- Used the current ServerLifecycleHooks for server access
- Updated entity handling for armor stands (used for hologram lines)
- Updated the command registration to use the new 1.19.2 system

## Challenges Overcome
- Dependency resolution issues with EnvyWare API modules
- Differences in package names and class structures between 1.16.5 and 1.19.2
- Changes in entity handling and networking in 1.19.2
- Command system changes in 1.19.2

## Final Result
The mod is now ready for use in Minecraft 1.19.2 with Forge. It maintains all the functionality of the original 1.16.5 version but uses updated classes and methods for the new Minecraft version.
