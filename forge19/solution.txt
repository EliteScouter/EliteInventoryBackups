# AdvancedHolograms 1.19.2 Porting Project

## What we've implemented

1. Created proper build.gradle for Forge 1.19.2
2. Implemented utility classes to replace EnvyWare API:
   - UtilChatColour
   - UtilWorld
   - UtilPlayer
   - UtilForgeConcurrency
   - UtilPlaceholder
   - UtilParse

3. Updated classes to use 1.19.2 package names and methods:
   - ForgeHolograms (main mod class)
   - HologramsConfig
   - ForgeHologram
   - HologramLine

4. Added command implementations for 1.19.2:
   - HologramsCommand
   - HologramsCreateCommand
   - HologramsDeleteCommand
   - HologramsAddLineCommand
   - HologramsSetLineCommand

## Steps to complete the port

1. Fix package structure
   All classes need to be placed in the correct package structure: `com.envyful.advanced.holograms.forge`. The IDE will show errors if this is not correctly set up.

2. Compile the mod
   Use the command `gradlew build` to compile the mod. This should create a JAR file in the `build/libs` directory.

3. Test the mod
   Test the mod in a Minecraft 1.19.2 server with Forge installed.

## Known issues

1. Dependencies
   We've been unable to successfully resolve the EnvyWare API forge19 dependency. This might be because it's not publicly available or because we're using the wrong version.

2. Our workaround
   We've implemented our own utility classes to replace the EnvyWare API. This might lead to differences in behavior, but it should work for the core functionality.

## Path forward

The key improvement would be to understand the exact dependency requirements for the EnvyWare API. However, our implementation should work for the core functionality without these dependencies.
