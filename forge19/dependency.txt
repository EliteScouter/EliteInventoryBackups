We're encountering build issues because:

1. The EnvyWare API dependencies are needed for the project, specifically forge19:7.2.8
2. The repository should be available at https://maven.envyware.co.uk/releases
3. We need to provide the correct Gradle configuration to download and use these dependencies

According to the EnvyWare documentation, these modules should be available:
- commons
- discord
- forge
- forge16
- forge19
- forge20
- spigot
- reforged
- reforged16

However, we've been unable to successfully resolve the forge19 module. This could be due to:

1. The module not being available in the public repository
2. The version number being incorrect (we tried 7.2.8)
3. Gradle configuration issues in our build.gradle file

To get around this issue, we have two options:

1. Adapt the 1.16.5 code to work with 1.19.2 without relying on the EnvyWare API
2. Recreate the required functionality from scratch for 1.19.2

We've been implementing the necessary utility classes from scratch to avoid the dependency issues.
